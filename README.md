This data was used to create the state and congressional district estimates. They use gender, age, education, and race from the survey and the most recent Census estimates using the American Community Survey most recent 5 year estimates.

The coding for the variables are:
Sex: 0-Women, 1-Men
Age: 1-18-24, 2-25-34, 3-35-44, 4-45-64, 5-65+
Educ: 1-HS or Less, 2-Some College/Associates, 3- College Graduate
Race: 1-18-24 years old, 2-White, 3-Non White (This is coded this way to combine with education as the more robust data on education is for people 25 years of age and older)
